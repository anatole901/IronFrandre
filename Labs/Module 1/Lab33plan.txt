Lab 33 Data preparation

I imported the dataset from Excel. I need to make some data preparation. First, I need to drop columns 7 and 8 and row 30 that do not belong to
the dataset.

Transaction and client columns seem OK. Birthyear column needs to be converted to integer since there are floating numbers here that are not
relevant. I need to correct the birthyear that is inconsistent and fill the missing values thanks to other lines with same client ID. In the
amount column, I need to delete the outlier value and replace it. In the profession column, I need to fill the missing values thanks to the
lines with same client ID and I need to format all the data to deal with inconstitencies. I need to delete the department column because all
data are the same in that column, so they are not relevant in this dataset. Column Risk is OK.
