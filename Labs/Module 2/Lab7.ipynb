    "In statistics, t-test is used to test if two data samples have a significant difference between their means. There are two types of t-test:\n",
    "\n",
    "Student's t-test (a.k.a. independent or uncorrelated t-test). This type of t-test is to compare the samples of two independent populations (e.g. test scores of students in two different classes). scipy provides the ttest_ind method to conduct student's t-test.\n",
    "\n",
    "Paired t-test (a.k.a. dependent or correlated t-test). This type of t-test is to compare the samples of the same population (e.g. scores of different tests of students in the same class). scipy provides the ttest_re method to conduct paired t-test.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both types of t-tests return a number which is called the p-value. If p-value is below 0.05, we can confidently declare the null-hypothesis is rejected and the difference is significant. If p-value is between 0.05 and 0.1, we may also declare the null-hypothesis is rejected but we are not highly confident. If p-value is above 0.1 we do not reject the null-hypothesis.\n",
