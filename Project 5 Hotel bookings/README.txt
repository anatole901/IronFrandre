In this project, I worked on the record of the bookings of an hotel group mostly present in Europe. I created a streamlit app that allows the user to get vizualisations made with python according to parameters that he inputs thanks to widgets in the sidebar.

To use the streamlit app, open an anaconda command line interface, go to the folder of the project and type the command : streamlit run project5.py
