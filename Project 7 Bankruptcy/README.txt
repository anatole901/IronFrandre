In this project, we have data about the financial health of asian companies and an indication if they went bankrupt or not. We implemented supervised machine learning models to predict the bankruptcy of a company given its other features. The steps were first to select the features that we want to use, then select the model. We implement the models, calculate their performance and compare the models.
