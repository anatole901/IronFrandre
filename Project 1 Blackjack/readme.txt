In this project, we implemented a program in Python that let us play blackjack. Find the code in the jupyter notebook,
the flowchart diagram in the .drawio file and the powerpoint presentation in the pxpt file. The Jira page for this project

Blackjack is a casino game played with a 52 traditionnal playing cards deck. The player draws cards until he decides to stand.
His score is the sum of the values of his cards. The dealer does the same but automatically hits at 16 or less points and stands
at 17 or more points. The player wins if his score is higher than the dealer's but not greater than 21 (if the dealer has more
than 21 points, we use 0 instead).
